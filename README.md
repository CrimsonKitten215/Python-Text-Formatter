# Python Text Formatter
This contains every way of formatting python's console text.


Why did I make this?

Well, for some reason nowhere online has a full extensive list of every code you can use to format/colour console text, so I pain-stakingly checked exactly how colour codes work, every single one that exists, and then put it in a massive list.

There's also a function I made that's in the same file that anyone can use if they want, which automatically formats text however you like without needing to memorise the codes. You're welcome!
